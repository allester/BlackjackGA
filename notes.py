''' Individuals
a player at a table

how many players do we want at a table?
one player one dealer

what if we have 5 players at a table and one dealer?
we will append the players gene table and fitness scores at the end of the game
but having multiple players at one table will cause our data to become dependent
we want to have indendent random data so they must be tested independently

if the player splits cards we will still consider it as one hand played since
it if we count this as 2 hands then we will affect the true value of the scores
and all players should have the same probability of having pairs
'''

''' Population
we will have a population size of genes x 1.5-2
